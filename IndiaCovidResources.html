<h1>Covid resources in India </h1>
<p> India is currently facing one of the biggest challenges it has faced in its existence -- a pandemic that is ravaging the country. Among the biggest challenges people face is lack of information. Where do I go? Which hospitals have beds? Where can I procure oxygen? Where do I get Remdesivir? And a whole lot more.

<p> It is not that information is unavailable. In fact, a great many people and organizations from across the country have created many websites and apps with information. However, the sheer number of these resources can itself make it hard to find the right one.

<p> Here we have tried to identify and list all the information resources currently on the web. We have tried to organize it by city, where possible. We have also tried to verify each of the pages before listing them here. Remember, these are often only starting points.
